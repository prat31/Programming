He has hardly ever sat on a ride. I love the adrenaline. Last I went to a fair I ended up riding the Giant wheel twice.

He is an early riser. Organized one like one in poems- Early to bed early to rise. I though I don't like closing eyes.

He wears his heart out on his sleeves- A persona that hardly fails to charm the people. Whereas I am more likely to be wooed, to be won over.

How is it that two people so contrary, so different in beliefs tend to believe in each other. It is bound to be the greatest mystery, greatest mystery of all. Love, they call. Funny that we humans resort to Supernatural entities, theories as mystery when one of the most common yet most deceitful one remains naked in front of our eyes. 

They explain this with biology, with terms out of renowned scientific anecdote. Physical attraction. True. Proved. But no one has ever explained how two lovers blindly put faith into each other and elope or a vernal traveler travels two cities in order to surprise his muse. None.

What is love? Magic, science or something out of the box.

Magic is not real but we breathe love as reality everyday. Science? Then why isn't there set rules? Why do people fail to find someone when so many surveys are out there? When exactly is the right time, who exactly is the right one? 

Mystery!
That would explain ironically why I want to end his fear of Gaint wheels. That would explain how he ends up talking with me waking the whole night. And that would explain why he has a little part of me inside him and why I try to embark things he does.

Love is Greatest mystery of all.
